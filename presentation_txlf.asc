Agenda
-------

* Introduction to High Availability (HA) and Clustering.

* Benefits of Highly Available applications.

* How HA is implemented on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.

* HA requirements on RHEL 7.

* Demo: Building a 3 node Apache cluster.


What is High Availability (HA)?
------------------------------

*In IT, High Availability refers to a system or component that is continuously operational for a desirably long length of time.*

=== 3 cores principles to HA: 
* Elimination of single point of failures.

* Reliable crossover.

* Detection of failures as they occur.

=== How High Availability is implemented on RHEL 7? 

*CLUSTERING!*

What is Clustering? 
-------------------
----
A cluster is a set of computers working together on a single task. Which task is performed, and how that task is performed, differs from cluster to cluster.
----
=== There are four (4) different kinds of clusters:
High-availability clusters:: Known as an HA cluster or failover cluster, their function is to keep running services as available as they can be. You could find them in two main configurations: 
* Active-Active (where a service runs on multiple nodes).
* Active-Passive (where a service only runs on one node at a time).

Load-balancing clusters:: All nodes run the same software and perform the same task at the same time and the requests from the clients are distributed between all the nodes.

Compute clusters:: Also know as high-performance computing (HPC) cluster. In these clusters tasks are divided into smaller chunks, which then get computed on different nodes.

Storage clusters:: All nodes provide a single cluster file system that will be used by clients to read and write data simultaneously.

Benefits of Highly Available applications.
------------------------------------------

=== In two words: "Application resiliency".

- Apply patches. 
- Planned outages. 
- Unplanned outages due to failures (server, software, network, storage).

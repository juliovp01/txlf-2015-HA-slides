Agenda
-------

* Introduction to High Availability (HA) and Clustering.

* Benefits of Highly Available applications.

* How HA is implemented on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.

* HA requirements on RHEL 7.

* Demo: Building a 3 node Apache cluster.


What is High Availability (HA)?
------------------------------

*In IT, High Availability refers to a system or component that is continuously operational for a desirably long length of time.*

=== 3 cores principles to HA: 
* Elimination of single point of failures.

* Reliable crossover.

* Detection of failures as they occur.

=== How High Availability is implemented on RHEL 7? 

*CLUSTERING!*

What is Clustering? 
-------------------
----
A cluster is a set of computers working together on a single task. Which task is performed, and how that task is performed, differs from cluster to cluster.
----
=== There are four (4) different kinds of clusters:
High-availability clusters:: Known as an HA cluster or failover cluster, their function is to keep running services as available as they can be. You could find them in two main configurations: 
* Active-Active (where a service runs on multiple nodes).
* Active-Passive (where a service only runs on one node at a time).

Load-balancing clusters:: All nodes run the same software and perform the same task at the same time and the requests from the clients are distributed between all the nodes.

Compute clusters:: Also know as high-performance computing (HPC) cluster. In these clusters tasks are divided into smaller chunks, which then get computed on different nodes.

Storage clusters:: All nodes provide a single cluster file system that will be used by clients to read and write data simultaneously.

Benefits of Highly Available applications.
------------------------------------------

=== In two words: "Application resiliency".

- Apply patches. 
- Planned outages. 
- Unplanned outages due to failures (server, software, network, storage).

=== Avoid this!

How HA is implemented on RHEL 7.
---------------------------------

=== Red Hat Enterprise Linux High Availability Add-On.

The High Availability Add-On consists of the following major components:

Cluster infrastructure:: Provides fundamental functions for nodes to work together as a cluster: configuration-file management, membership management, lock management, and fencing.

High availability Service Management:: Provides failover of services from one cluster node to another. 

Cluster administration tools:: Configuration and management tools for setting up, configuring, and management.


__To provide the above services multiple
software components are required on the cluster nodes.__

How HA is implemented on RHEL 7.
---------------------------------

=== Software

The cluster infrastructure software is provided by *Pacemaker* and performs the next set of functions: 

*   Cluster management
*   Lock management
*   Fencing
*   Cluster configuration management

==== Cluster software: 

[horizontal]
pacemaker:: It's responsible for all cluster-related activities, such as monitoring cluster membership, managing the services and resources, and fencing cluster members. The RPM contains three (3) important components:
* Cluster Information Base (CIB).
* Cluster Resource Management Daemon (CRMd).
corosync:: This is the framework used by Pacemaker for handling communication between the cluster nodes.
pcs:: Provides a command-line interface to create, configure, and control every aspect of a Pacemaker/corosync cluster.

Requirements
------------
Here are some requirements and limits for *Pacemaker*. 

==== Number of Nodes:
* Up to 16 nodes per cluster. 
* Minimum number of nodes: 3. 
-   2 nodes cluster could be configured but is not recommended.

==== Cluster location:
* *Single site*: A cluster setup where all cluster members are
in the same physical location, connected by a local area network. (Supported).
* *Multisite*: Two clusters, one active and one for disaster recovery. Failover for multisite clusters must be managed manually. (Supported).
* *Strech (or) Geo Clusters*: Clusters stretched out over multiple physical locations.
